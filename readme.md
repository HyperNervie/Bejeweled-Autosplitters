# Auto Splitters for Bejeweled Franchise

This repository holds auto splitters used for speedrun categories of ~~Bejeweled~~ (coming soon), ~~Bejeweled 2~~ (coming soon), Bejeweled Twist and ~~Bejeweled 3~~ (coming soon). You can enable them in the Splits Editor.

## Bejeweled Twist

[Bejeweled Twist categories on speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/bejeweledtwist)

Unfortunately the author has only non-Steam version of Bejeweled Twist so whether this auto splitter supports Steam version is unknown. If it doesn't, and you figure out how to make it work on Steam version, feel free to open a pull request.

Timing starts upon entering any level. Split takes place whenever you earn stars. If you want to split upon beating a whole planet rather than beating a single challenge, check "Don't split upon beating challenges 1-6" in auto splitter settings.

This auto splitter doesn't support Boggy's Counterclockwise Extension. There's no plan to support it until there are CCW categories on speedrun.com.
