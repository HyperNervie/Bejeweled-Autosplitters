# Auto Splitters for Bejeweled Franchise

There's only an auto splitter for Bejeweled Twist, but those for Bejeweled Deluxe, 2 and 3 will be here in the future.

Unfortunately the author has only non-Steam version of Bejeweled Twist so whether this auto splitter supports Steam version is unknown. If it doesn't, and you figure out how to make it work on Steam version, feel free to open a pull request.

Timing starts upon entering any level. Split takes place whenever you earn stars. If you want to split upon beating a whole planet rather than beating a single challenge, check "Don't split upon beating challenges 1-6" in layout settings; this doesn't affect Classic and Zen modes.

This auto splitter doesn't support Boggy's Counterclockwise Extension. There's no plan to support it until there are CCW categories on speedrun.com.
